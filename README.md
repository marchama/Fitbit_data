# Fitbit_data


I ran this project to apply, use and get familiar a bit with the new tools I am learning in the 'Data Scientist Journey' training I am taking in my company. 

You can find the codes of the project itself in the file 'Fitbit Analysis.ipynb'. I saved some sample of the input files I had in the folder 'Inputs'
